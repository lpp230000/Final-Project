# Proposal

## Title


## Description
For this project I want to create a piece of digital artwork that uses the editing and digital rain lessons. For this artwork I want it to be a water fall location with rain and surronded by woods.

## Features
The features I'm planning to use are the adding a water mark with the editing features and then also utilize the particle rain to make particles look like rain down the river.

## Challenges
The main challenge I'll have is trying to make the particles longer to immitate falling pixal rain
