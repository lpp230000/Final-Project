# Proposal

## Title
The Flows of a Waterfall

## Description
For this project I want to create a piece of digital artwork that uses the editing and digital rain lessons. For this artwork I want it to be a water fall location with rain and surronded by woods.

## Features
The features I'm planning to use are the adding a water mark with the <ins>editing features</ins> and then also utilize the <ins>particle rain</ins> to make particles look like rain down the river.

## Challenges
The main challenge I'll have is trying to make the <ins>particles longer to immitate falling pixal rain</ins>
## Outcomes

### Ideal Outcomes
The ideal outcome I hope for is to be able to have the particle rain take the proper shape and timing. Another ideal outcome is that the water mark is properly place while the particle rain can properly look over it
### Minimal Viable Outcomes
the minimum viable outcome is that i get the particle rain to work with the right color however the shape might be closer to the default. I also want the particle rain to at least look like it is part of the artwork and not just it seperately
## Milestones
For the first week I want to beginning set up the water mark code while also begin designing the artwork on my digital program. The following week I want to at least have the image be done by the middle of the week. After that the goal is to start the water mark editing code and finish that by the following week. Lastly I want to spend the final 2 weeks working on the particle rain and to properly test it.
